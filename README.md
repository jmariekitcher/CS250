How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    Interpreting user needs happens by creating user stories that fit the requests of the customer, and align with the abilities of the team.
    
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I think I am still a ways out from developing programs, but studying the agile process this term has helped me to put together all of the moving parts fro start to finish. I found each stage in agile more interesting than the last, and I identified heavily with several of the roles, including Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Tester. I even really liked the idea of becoming Scrum certified and working as an agile consultant. It is clear the possibilities are endless. 
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  To be a good team member in software development is to care as much about the project as everyone else does, be self-starting, collaborate often, and have open discussions providing feedback while maintaining professionalism. Another important part of being on a team, and especially with agile, is flexibility. Being able to handle last minute changes or new directions based on changing needs of the client needs to be done with grace, since you are after all working for the customer, not just what you want the program to do.
